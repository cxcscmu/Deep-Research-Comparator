## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend - Environment Setup

Run the following commands to set up the Python environment:

```bash
cd backend 
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n deepresearch_comparator python=3.12
conda activate deepresearch_comparator

# Install the packages  in development mode
pip install - r master_requirements.txt

# We can also create separate virtual environments for the main backend and the three supported agents
cd app
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd gpt_researcher_server
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd perplexity_server
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd Simple_DeepResearch_server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Frontend - Setup

Run the following commands to set up the Frontend :

```bash
cd frontend

npm install 
```


## üöÄ Run 

### 1. Environment Setup 

#### Main Backend 
The main backend present in `/app` directory expects the PostgresSQL Database connection parameters and the HTTP API endpoints of the participating agents through the file `keys.env` whose structure is presented below	

```bash
AWS_ENDPOINT = "YOUR DATABASE URL"
DB_NAME = "YOUR DATABASE NAME"
DB_USERNAME = "YOUR DATABASE USERNAME"
DB_PASSWORD = "YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD"
GPT_RESEARCHER_URL = http://localhost:5004/run
PERPLEXITY_URL = http://localhost:5005/run
BASELINE_URL = http://localhost:5003/run
```
#### SIMPLE DEEPRESEARCH (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
This agent expects the Gemini API key in a file titled `keys.env` whose structure is presented below
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" 
```
#### Perplexity DeepResearch
This agent expects the Perplexity API key in a file titled `keys.env` whose structure is presented below
```bash
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = "YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY"
```
#### GPT Researcher
Since we have used Serper as the search engine instead of the default Tavily for our experimented the environment  for GPT Researcher is configured as follows
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
export SERPER_API_KEY = "YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY"
export RETRIEVER=serper
```
### 2. Platform Setup (dev environment)
To set up the platform, we need 5 bash terminals: one for the frontend, one for the main backend, and three for the agents.
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
```bash
cd backend/app
python app.py
```

```bash
cd backend/gpt_researcher_server
python main.py
```
```bash
cd backend/perplexity_server
python main.py
```
```bash
cd backend/Simple_DeepResearch_server
python main.py
```
If all the default settings the followed the platform should be available in : http://localhost:5173/
